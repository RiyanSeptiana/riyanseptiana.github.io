                                            <p>This is an automatic distillation system. Where this machine can simulate the distillation process by using level sensors, temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. The distillation process is the process of making oil by using essential plants which are given water vapor, which will automatically separate the water and oil. Each sensor used has its own actuator. Level sensor, the sensor functions to detect the water level, if the level is less then the pump will turn on, and vice versa when the water is sufficient then the pump will stop. Temperature sensor, this sensor functions to measure the temperature of the tank. If water is available and the room temperature is cold, the heater will turn on, and vice versa, when the temperature is too hot, the heater will turn off. The last one is the pressure sensor, this sensor functions to detect the tank pressure, if it feels that the tank pressure is sufficient, it will open a valve which will later carry steam to the essential plants so that the pressure received by the plants is ideal and able to produce better quality oil. When the pressure drops, the valve will be closed to produce the desired pressure.</p>

                                            <p>This project is called IOT-based Chicken Coop Management. In this project we can control and monitor the chicken coop from feeding, drinking, and adjusting the temperature. The control and monitoring system will be accessible via an Android Smartphone. This project uses 3 sensors and 3 actuators, where each sensor has access to activate the actuator. The first system is the feeding of chickens, where the container of chicken feed will be detected by the ultrasonic sensor, when the ultrasonic sensor detects an object closely, it means that there is food there. on the other hand, when the ultrasonic sensor detects a distant object, it can mean that there is no food in the container, so the servo motor will move to open the door to remove the chicken feed. The second system is drinking, when the water sensor detects low-level water, the system will send a signal to activate the pump so that the water container will be filled and the pump will stop when the water reaches a certain level. The last system is temperature adjustment use DHT11 sensor, when the sensor detects a low temperature, the system will send a signal to turn on the light very brightly, otherwise when the sensor detects a high temperature, the light will get dimmers and even turn off. All of these signals will be stored in a firebase, and can be accessed directly by the Android system</p>

                                            <p>A supervisor can still monitor production activities without having to be in an operating plant, checking production history and so on. The production process which consists of several plants can be controlled through a single computer connected to the network. To monitor a process control, it is necessary to control a system with simulations that can show conditions in real time and controls that can send data to the plant even remotely. There is software that provides these features, such as for example Wonderware to help monitor the control of the process. This project is used to create a Distributed Control System that can monitor a plan handling station using Wonderware Intouch and make data acquisition by saving data to a SQL server and excel.</p>

                                            <p>This Project is control 3 air conditioner server room Polman Bandung. Each air conditioner will on for 2 days alternately. The system will record temperature and save to database used MySQL and ANTARES. Beside that the system will send notification to the operator if the air conditioner’s temperature isn’t normal. To save the energy the system used ultrasonic sensor to turn on the lamp when there is a person in the server room.</p>

                                            <p>This project is used for Covid 19 patients with respiratory failure. There are 2 mode that control with this machine, there are volume control and pressure control. This machine use pressure sensor, oxygen sensor, and flow sensor to get any parameter then calculate to control servo motor. There are some alarm than can show in HMI and buzzer. This machine can control and monitor with nodered application server</p>

                                            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost all parts of the world. This situation requires the community to do social distancing, including activities in the hospital. One of these activities is the provision of nutrition to patients. there are some problem in the infusion process like bubbles, delays in changing infusions, clogged fluids, excess volume, and inconsistant flow rates. This machine uses hardware consisting of ESP32 and Arduino Nano as controllers, optocoupler sensors as droplet detectors, bubble sensors as bubble detectors, nextion and nodered as interfaces, servo motors as hose suppressors, and buzzers as alarm indications. There are some result from this research like droplet detection has an accuracy rate of 100%, flow rate calculation has an accuracy of 94.52%, volume calculation has an accuracy of 95.53%, hazard detection such as bubbles, run out of liquid, clogged liquid, excess volume, and inappropriate flowrate has 100% accuracy, PI controller has parameters Kp = 0.05 and Ki = 0.1.</p>
